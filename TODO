[x] use the whole screen height of 24
[x] draw borders, so the users know where the walls are
    - use grey for this
[x] prevent players from moving back into themselves
    (can deal with the input-swallowing, no-buffer feeling later)
[x] choose your color!
    [x] translate keycodes into colors, for both players
    [x] add logic to the first-input loop to set player color
    [x] remember each player's color between games
[x] instructions between games
[x] try it out

UX ideas
* make the arena 3x2 dims:
    * 34x23 including the walls
    * 3 spaces padding on left and right sides
    * 1 space padding *either* above or below (tbd)
    * this encourages ties until ppl figure out how to play

Qs:
* how to make ppl realize they can change colors?
* what to show players at the start?
* what to show players b/w games
* how to do a count-down for game start
* score-keeping / match UX ?
