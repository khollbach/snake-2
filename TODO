[x] use the whole screen height of 24
[x] draw borders, so the users know where the walls are
    - use grey for this
[x] prevent players from moving back into themselves
    (can deal with the input-swallowing, no-buffer feeling later)
[x] choose your color!
    [x] translate keycodes into colors, for both players
    [x] add logic to the first-input loop to set player color
    [x] remember each player's color between games

Qs:
[x] what to show players at the start?
[x] how to do a count-down for game start?
[x] what to show players b/w games?
[x] score-keeping / match UX ?
[-] how to make ppl realize they can change colors?
    * maybe add q/e to switch left/right (and u/o for p2)
    * having both options makes it more likely to be discovered
    * this should work from any non-arena screen, at any time.
    * then again, this still doesn't feel great...
    * maybe some sort of cheat-code thing? idk.
    * this is very low priority; come back to it when you're done everything else
    * tbh probably just some text on the start screen ?
        ~ NUMBERS/SYMBOLS
          TO CHANGE COLOR
    * ^possibly only show it when score is 0/0

Now:

Features to impl:
